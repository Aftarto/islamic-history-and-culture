    <h2 class="islam">Islam:</h2>
    <h3 class="home-islam">Lexical meaning of Islam</h3>
        <p class="home-p">If you refer to Arabic language dictionaries, you will find that the meaning of the word <em>Islam is: submission</em>, humbling oneself, and obeying commands and heeding prohibitions without objection, sincerely worshipping <strong>Allah</strong> alone, believing what He tells us and having faith in Him.<br>

        The word <em>Islam</em> has become the name of the religion which was brought by <em>Prophet Muhammad</em> (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). </p>
    <h3 class="home-islam">Why this religion is called Islam</h3>
        <p class="home-p">All the religions on earth are called by various names, either the name of a specific man or a specific nation. So Christianity takes its name from Christ; Buddhism takes its name from its founder, the Buddha; the Zoroastrians became well known by this name because their founder and standard-bearer was Zoroaster.<br>

            Similarly, Judaism took its name from a tribe known as Yehudah (Judah), so it became known as Judaism. And so on.<br>

            Except for <em>Islam</em>; for it is not attributed to any specific man or to any specific nation, rather its name refers to the meaning of the word <em>Islam</em>. What this name indicates is that the establishment and founding of this religion was not the work of one particular man and that it is not only for one particular nation to the exclusion of all others. Rather its aim is to give the attribute implied by the word <em>Islam</em> to all the peoples of the earth. So everyone who acquires this attribute, whether he is from the past or the present, is a Muslim, and everyone who acquires this attribute in the future will also be a Muslim.<br>

            And <strong>Allah</strong> knows best.</p>
